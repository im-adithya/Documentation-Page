    <header>Introduction</header>
    <p>Computers are dumb. They only do what they’re told. How do you tell a
       computer what to do? You use a programming language. The very first thing
       you’ll do when learning a new programming language is how to make the
       computer display “Hello, World”.
    </p>
    <p>There is no perfect programming language, they all offer something a little
       different, and there are hundreds of programming languages with new ones
       being created every day.
    </p>
    <p>Here is a selection of programming languages that have a place in the
       programming hall of fame. They’re all either used today or have contributed
       something to the art of computer languages.
    </p>
  </section><br>
  <section class="main-section" id="Assembly_Language">
    <header>Assembly Language</header>
    <p>This is the language that will get you the highest performing and most
      efficient software that is still human-readable. It’s so hard to write
      in that it only makes sense to use it for small parts of a programme that
      are performance-sensitive. You will find it in operating systems and 3D
      game engines.
    </p><br>
    <ul><li>Here's the code for it:</li></ul>
      <code>
        global  _main<br>
        extern  _printf<br>
        <br>
        section .text<br>
      _main:
        push    message<br>
        call    _printf<br>
        add     esp, 4<br>
        ret<br>
      message:<br>
        db  'Hello, World', 10, 0<br>
      </code>
  </section><br>
  <section class="main-section" id="C">
    <header>C</header>
    <p>The most important language in the world. It’s what operating systems
      like Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android are written in, as well as browsers
      and 3D games engines. Its syntax has influenced countless other programming
      languages.</p>
    <p>C maps closely to Assembly Language but you can write more complex
      programmes with it. If you need the highest performance possible without
      losing your mind then C is for you.</p>
    <p>C is also the language that made “Hello, World” examples popular.
    </p><br>
    <ul><li>Here's the code for it:</li></ul>
    <code>
      #include <stdio.h><br>
      <br>
      int main(void)<br>
      {<br>
          printf("hello, world\n");<br>
      }<br>
    </code>
  </section><br>
  <section class="main-section" id="C++">
    <header>C++</header>
    <p>Has performance close to C and is used in many important projects like
      the Chrome Browser. C++ was an effort to make a language that was easier
      to build large projects with while still being fast and efficient.
    </p><br>
    <ul><li>Here's the code for it:</li></ul>
    <code>
      #include <iostream>
        <br>
        int main()<br>
        {<br>
            std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";<br>
            return 0;<br>
        }<br>
    </code>
  </section><br>
  <section class="main-section" id="Javascript">
    <header>JavaScript</header>
    <p>JavaScript is the most commonly found programming language in the world.
      Mainly because it is required to be in every web browser. JavaScript is
      what makes the web dynamic and interactive. It was standardised under the
      name ECMAScript.
    </p><br>
    <ul><li>Here's the code for it:</li></ul>
    <code>
    console.log("Hello World!");<br>
    </code>
  </section><br>
  <section class="main-section" id="Python">
    <header>Python</header>
    <p>Has a compact syntax needing far fewer lines of code than languages like
      Java or C++. It’s very popular and is used for websites and artificial
      intelligence (AI) tasks.
    </p><br>
    <ul><li>Here's the code for it:</li></ul>
    <code>
    print("Hello World")<br><br>
    </code>
  </section>
</main>
</body>
